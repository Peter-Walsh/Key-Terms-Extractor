# Key-Terms-Extractor
NLP project where I attempted to extract the subject of several news articles. To start I just counted the fequency of the words. Then I moved on to do some POS-tagging and normalization. My final attempt involved calculating the TF-IDF scores of each of the words for all the articles.
